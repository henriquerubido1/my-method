			<p className="m-4">Now that we have already covered the topic "Autodidactism", we can understand what makes a good tool. In order to choose great tools for your learning, you have to understand the difference between abilities and knowledge. Abilities are skills that you can only learn through practice, riding a bicycle, for example. You can read a thousand books about how to ride a bicycle, but you will not learn to do so untill you actually get on it and try to ride the bicycle. Yes, books can give you very useful tips, but the point is: IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE AN ABILITY, YOU NEED TO PRACTICE IT. The abilities you need to practice to learn a language are: reading, writing, listening and speaking. Grammar is also an ability, but you end up learning most of it through the other ones, therefore there is no need to practice it individually. Talking about knowledge, it can be described as information and it is acquired through studying, Geography, for instance, is knowledge. You can acquire knowledge reading a book or studying in other ways, too. Vocabulary is Knowledge in language learning.</p>
