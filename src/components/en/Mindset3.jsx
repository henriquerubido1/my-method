			<p className="m-4">Another topic that is very underestimated in the language learning community is the belief that you have that the method you are using works. This sounds trivial, but at times, we feel like we are stagnated and then we decide to try another method. And after doing this many times, we realize that we have had the same beginner content over and over. Different books or apps do not know what your current level is, thus they will try to teach you the basics of the language again and you will be wasting you time and you will see no progress, which leads to frustration. So, if you have chosen a method that is proven to work and you enjoy it, STICK TO IT, give it some time. Sometimes the results are not easy to see, especially during the first month.</p>
