			<p className="m-4">I cannot start this topic without mentioning what autodidactism is and what it is not. Autodidactism does not mean learning alone and/or with no help, autodidactism means to be the lord of your own learning process. You must always be in control of what you learn, when you learn and how you are going to do so. Think about every method, teacher, book or app as a TOOL. When building something, you should know which tool you will need for each part. If you need to improve your vocabulary, you will need a tool, maybe a book, but if you need to improve your pronunciation, you will need a different tool, a conversation class, for instance. Always think about which tool is necessary at the moment.</p>
